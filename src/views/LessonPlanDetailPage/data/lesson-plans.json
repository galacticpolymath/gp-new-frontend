Students learn how scientists and birders alike have assumed for decades that most female birds don't sing. As students explore real data from a recent study, they will learn how this assumption could be reinforced by the fact that females sing much less than males, and further, how this biased oversight has limited our understanding of bird research from its very beginnings. [See Scientific Background](#background) for details.\n  \nThe lesson will take 3 class periods for most learners. Students dive in with a data literacy puzzle, which we call a “Polymath Puzzle.” Students are given a figure from a current scientific study on barn swallows (a common bird across the world), but with text elements coded with an alphabetic shift (e.g. each letter is shifted: A to B, B to C, and so on). They have to work in teams (or individually) to decipher the messages, and then try to understand the figure. This is a high-level data literacy task that piques students’ natural love of puzzle-solving, while working on GRIT/grappling and the [21st Century Skills (4 Cs)](https://www.aeseducation.com/blog/four-cs-21st-century-skills). Videos guide students through each stage of the Polymath Puzzle. In Parts 2 and 3, students create and interpret histograms from the same data, allowing for a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of scatter plots and histograms for visualizing data patterns. The culminating task is for students to synthesize the conclusions from the two types of graph, along with additional background information to hypothesize a reason for why female song has been missed until 2020 in this widely studied species.","InitiallyExpanded":true},{"__component":"lesson-plan.section-heading","id":3,"SectionTitle":"Teaching Materials"},{"__component":"teaching-resources.teaching-resources","id":3,"SectionTitle":"Teaching Materials","Data":{"remote":{"resources":[{"parts":[{"part":1,"title":"Ciphers and Data Visuals","preface":"Part 1 will take a full class period and is broken into 4 time chunks.

Introduction to Ciphers\nThe presentation provides background for our *Polymath Puzzle,* including new vocabulary. By spending some time introducing students to ciphers, we are laying the groundwork for cipher-based puzzle hooks for each part of this lesson (and future lessons). The Polymath Puzzle in Part 1 draws students into decoding the labels on a graph in order to engage them in trying to understand the next level of meaning in the graph, creating a rich data literacy learning experience. In the first step, students learn that ciphers are used to make a secret message. We use a simple cipher called an alphabetic shift, where each letter of each word in a message has been shifted a certain number of places (e.g. +1 would mean A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on). This section works on assimilating new vocabulary, as well as encouraging students to have a growth mindset. They need to quickly orient themselves to the \"system\" of ciphers and how they work. Parts 2 and 3 will build on this engagement hook.\n\n> **VOCAB:**\n> - **algorithm:** a set of steps, like a mathematical recipe\n> - **alphabetic shift:** type of cipher where each letter has been shifted a certain number of places (dictated by the algorithm)\n> - **cipher:** a secret message that uses an algorithm to make a message seem like nonsense\n> - **decipher:** 1) convert a secret message into readable text; 2) to succeed in understanding something \n> - **encipher:** convert readable text (plaintext) into a secret message\n> - **plaintext:** readable text (not a cipher)\n\n***Tip:** Ask students to read slides and predict what the next slide will be (e.g. the next letter in the alphabetic shift). Model a growth mindset, and that it's ok to not completely understand at first.*\n\n##### 2. Cipher Practice\nStudents practice determining an algorithm given plaintext (a normal message) or a cipher (secret message, with a shifted alphabet).\n\n***Differentiation Notes:** In the remote version students provide responses digitally using Nearpod.*\n\n***Tip:** All remote versions of GP lessons can be completed using a [free Nearpod account](https://nearpod.com/pricing).*\n\n\n#### ↓ (10 min) Deciphering the Graph\n![Part 1 segment 2 of 4](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617668356/Part1_seg_2of4_clek0d.png)\n\n\n##### 3. The *Polymath Puzzle*\nStudents use their new skills to decipher the coded axes of a scatter plot graph representing data from a real scientific study.\n***Differentiation Notes:** Decipher algorithms for grade bands—G5-6, 7-8: (-1 shift; A->Z) and G9-12: (+3 shift; A->D)*\n\n***Tip:** Set a definite time limit (e.g. 5min) to solve and enter deciphered text, and move on. The videos will clear up any misunderstandings.*\n\n##### 4. How to Solve the Cipher\nStudents watch the video “Strategies for solving this Polymath Puzzle” to scaffold student understanding.\n\n***Differentiation Notes:** Students will either discuss their strategies (in-person) or choose which strategy they adopted (remote).*\n\n\n#### ↓ (15 min) Understanding the Graph\n![Part 1 segment 3 of 4](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617668356/Part1_seg_3of4_eljtws.png)\n\n##### 5. What Does it Mean?\nStudents will watch the included video “How do we read this graph?” to scaffold understanding. Then they’ll discuss as a class.\n> Students share all their observations and wonderings about the graph. They then come up with their own educated guesses (hypotheses) for what the graph's story is. (i.e. What species is being studied? What patterns are shown? What was being studied?)\n\n***Differentiation Notes:** For the remote version, classroom discussion/ brainstorming is done with a Nearpod Collaboration Board. [If doing student-paced lesson, this will need to be enabled.](https://nearpod.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048806572-How-to-use-a-Collaborate-Board-in-a-Nearpod-lesson)*\n\n***Tip:** Encourage any student observations or guesses at the graph's meaning, no matter how basic. Start with, what kind of data are on the X and Y axes? Which sex has the most songs per day? Are there any \"weird\" points (outliers) that stand out from the rest?*\n\n##### 6. Mystery Reveal\nStudents will watch “Ready to see if you were right?”, which connects the puzzle to current research and data literacy. \n\n\n#### ↓ (5 min) Introducing histograms and the idea that choice of graph matters\n![Part 1 segment 4 of 4](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617668356/Part1_seg_4of4_xql9a4.png)\n#### 7. Pivot to Histograms\nStudents learn about how the study’s original authors were questioned on their use of scatter plots vs histograms. \n\n> **VOCAB:**\n> - **data visualization:** a representation of numbers or other types of data in a way that makes it easier to see patterns. \n> Ex: scatter plots, histograms, & other types of graph\n\n##### 8. Choice of Data Visuals\nStudents watch “Is a scatter plot the right way to tell this data’s story?” which connects scatter plots to histograms and pivots to Part 2 of this lesson. \n> Students are briefly introduced to the concept of peer review & learn about how scientists (& everyone) can disagree about the best way to represent data. Students are put into the shoes of the study's authors and over the next two sessions will learn what a histogram is, make the histogram with the real data, and determine whether the study reviewer was right in suggesting that a histogram would be better than a scatter plot to show this data. **A key concept here is that understanding graphs is a type of literacy that gives us power.**\n\n##### 9. Reflection\nPart 1 ends with a customizable reflection slide and review of covered vocabulary, and topics. \n> Reflection Ideas:\n> - What types of data have you seen represented as a scatter plot?\n> - Why do you think female barn swallow song has been ignored until 2020? (This will be a repeated theme.)\n> - 3-2-1: 3 things I learned today; 2 things I found especially interesting; 1 question I still have.\n\n### Part 2: From Tables to Graphs\nStudents learn how to make dot plots and learn how histograms are made by binning data into ranges. This lesson is slightly shorter than the other two parts.\n\n#### ↓ (8 min) Warm Up Cipher\n![Part 2, segment 1 of 5](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617740065/Part2_seg_1of5_osp6xk.png)\n##### 1. Engagement Hook\nStudents begin by solving an alphabetic shift. “Cherry Trees” is a reference to the histogram example...leave it for students to notice. \n#### ↓ (5 min) Review\n![Part 2, segment 2 of 5](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617740065/Part2_seg_2of5_x2l9of.png)\n##### 2. Review\nStudents rewatch the video \"Is a scatter plot the right way to tell this data's story?\"\n#### ↓ (15 min) Background for Understanding Histograms\n![Part 2, segment 3 of 5](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617740065/Part2_seg_3of5_ywcbow.png)\n##### 3. Concept: Range\nStudents learn new vocab: data visualization, histogram, bins, and range. Then histogram is explained through a real world example of heights of cherry trees. Students will answer a question about the range in Nearpod.\n\n##### 4. Concept: Dot Plot\nStudents follow along as the presentation shows how the data is used to create a Dot Plot. Check-in formative assessments of understanding are built in.\n\n##### 5. Concept: Binning\nStudents watch “Combining Data Points into Bins” and then follow along as the presentation shows how to bin the cherry tree data.\n> This video has some silly sound effects which will hopefully increase engagement and help students remember the connections between dot plots and histograms.\n\n#### ↓ (7 min) Synthesis\n![Part 2, segment 4 of 5](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617740065/Part2_seg_4of5_ylrqqu.png)\n##### 6. Analyzing the Data\nWhile showing the completed histogram, presentation asks two questions prompting analysis and critical review of the graph, with ability to answer in Nearpod. \n\n#### ↓ (5 min) Review & Reflection\n![Part 2, segment 5 of 5](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617740065/Part2_seg_5of5_i4arv3.png)\n##### 7. Review\nA quick review of the steps just taken (find range, create dot plot, bin data, draw bars to create histogram) to prep students for Part 3. \n\n##### 8. Check-In\nStudents are asked to match graphs to their names.  \n> The end of Part 2 ends with a customizable reflection slide and review of covered vocabulary, and topics. \n*Tip: Part 3 is a bit longer, so if you have extra time, you may want to preview part of what's coming up tomorrow.*\n\n### Part 3: Visualizing Song Data\nStudents create a histogram from raw data and use the scatter plot and histogram for reflection and synthesis. They will also synthesize all they have learned about histograms, dot plots, scatter plots, and the barn swallow study to answer big questions about why female song has been missed in this common species and why that matters.\n#### ↓ (5 min) Warm-Up & Review\n![Part 3, segment 1 of 6](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617668358/Part3_seg_1of6_ozr6yc.png)\n##### 1. Engagement Hook\nStudents warm up with a cipher. They need to shift back 3 to decipher “FEMALES SING,” referring to the overlooked fact that many species of birds sing, just less frequently than males.\n***Tip:** Make sure to only spend a few minutes on the warm-up. This is a longer lesson.\n\n##### 2. Review\nStudents get reoriented to the driving question: *Is a scatter plot the right way to show the data?* The scientist peer reviewer had suggested that a histogram would be better. Students will make a histogram and decide if they agree.\n\n#### ↓ (10 min) Getting to Know Your Data\n![Part 3, segment 2 of 6](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617668358/Part3_seg_2of6_z0btja.png)\n##### 3. Understanding Table 1\nStudents are guided through understanding what the data are and how they are categorized in Table 1. This is the raw data, representing the number of songs recorded for each bird, along with their sex & ID code.\n\n##### 4. Connecting the Data to Reality\nThe “Counting Swallow Song” video shows what barn swallow song sounds like and how songs were counted, to deepen connection to the data. (It’s not said, but this is male song. Female song is not shown in this lesson. See the bonus video for examples).\n\n##### 5. Check-In\nStudents are reminded of how data points are plotted on a dot plot. To check in they’re asked to draw the missing point (remote) or say how many songs the missing bird sang (in-person).\n\n#### ↓ (10 min) Mini-Review & Worked Example of How To Bin Data\n![Part 3, segment 3 of 6](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617668358/Part3_seg_3of6_qzcssq.png)\n##### 6. Synthesis\nPresentation reviews the cherry tree height data from Part 2 to show how data organization affects the type of graph you can make. We want to bin the data in order to make a histogram to answer our driving question: Is a scatter plot or histogram better to visualize our song data?\n\n##### 7. Binning Data\nStudents are walked through what a “bin” is (a range of data points that get combined), and how this looks in table and graph form.\n\n##### 8. Worked Example\nStudents are walked through how to count up the raw data in Table 1 and bin them in Table 2.\n\n***Differentiation Notes:** For G5-8 versions, male data is binned for them. In G9-12, students have to bin both sexes, which are also coded as “one” and “two” in order to require a deeper understanding as the older students figure out which is male and female by comparing the two graphs.*\n\n#### ↓ (5 min) Students Bin the Remaining Data\n![Part 3, segment 4 of 6](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617668359/Part3_seg_4of6_xft7bx.png)\n##### 9. Students Bin Data\nStudents fill out Table 2 by binning the raw data in Table 1. (All they have to do is count up the number of individual birds who sang a number of songs in a given range).\n> Students have the option of copying it down on scratch paper or downloading it as a word document (linked in the presentation). If using in-person version, the worksheet is provided.\n***Teaching Tip:** It's important to set a hard time limit on this step, otherwise, it may eat up class time. You may consider doing the whole table as a class together, depending on your class's grade or motivation level.*\n\n#### ↓ (5 min) Students Draw a Histogram from Table 2\n![Part 3, segment 5 of 6](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617668359/Part3_seg_5of6_tdgac4.png)\n##### 10. Students Draw Histogram\nStudents use their binned data to create the histogram. G5-8 students only need to make the female histogram. G9-12 make both (except for 2 example bins which are done as an example). \n***Differentiation Notes:** Students will draw the histogram digitally or on their worksheet, based on remote or in-person teaching.*\n***Teaching Tip:** Again, make sure to provide a clear time limit on this step in order to finish.*\n\n#### ↓ (10 min) Wrapping Up\n![Part 3, segment 6 of 6](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1617668358/Part3_seg_6of6_hmdtmq.png)\n##### 11. Connecting the Dots\nStudents are asked to solve one of two puzzles, depending on their grade level. Both tasks assess how well students understand how the same data is represented in the 2 graphs.\n##### 12. Reflection\nStudents are asked a set of reflection questions and should conclude that the scatter plot is a better visualization for this data set because: with the histogram, we lose out on the important detail that females only sing early in the spring.\n\n***Differentiation Notes:** Task: (G5-8) Draw the legend on the scatterplot from comparing to the male and female histograms or (G9-12) figure out the true sex of the coded “one” (female) and “two” (male) histograms from looking at the scatterplot with labeled sexes.*\n\n##### 13. Discussion & Synthesis\nPart 3 has a customizable discussion. You may copy and edit slides to make it your own if you prefer.\n> **Key Take-Homes to Drive Toward During Reflection**\n> - Female birds sing, and this has been neglected for decades, holding back scientific research into animal behavior\n> - 1 reason for this is the assumption/bias that females don’t sing. This is self-fulfilling, as females often look similar to males, sing much less in total & only sing early in the breeding season.\n> - This is a form of confirmation bias (though we don’t introduce that term), where we may latch onto evidence that confirms our preexisting assumptions. (And we should be wary of that).\n> - The scatter plot was a better visualization for this data because it shows the timing of song and when scientists need to focus study of female song to address this gap in our knowledge.\n\n\n\n### Finished teaching? \n#### We want to know what you and your students thought!\n[Please share your thoughts using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdz7_81uUZrsmEfdXk-DPW5J72gViBUO-cy2sakojs5sqAAqQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we will use it to improve this and other future lessons.\n","Data":{"parts":[{"chunks":[{"steps":[{"Step":1,"Vocab":"- **algorithm :** a set of steps, like a mathematical recipe\r\n- **alphabetic shift:** type of cipher where each letter has been shifted a certain number of places (dictated by the algorithm)\r\n- **cipher:** a secret message that uses an algorithm to make a message seem like nonsense\r\n- **decipher:** 1) to convert a secret message into readable text; 2) to succeed in understanding something \r\n- **encipher:** convert readable text (plaintext) into a secret message\r\n- **plaintext:** readable text (not a cipher)","StepTitle":"Introduction to Ciphers","StepDetails":"By spending some time introducing students to ciphers, we are laying the groundwork for cipher-based puzzle hooks for each part of this lesson.

Decoding it will require them to gain new tech skills.

Search for a “hex to text converter.” Translate the Task # on the front page to get a secret web link.\n\nThis is a fun “tech-savviness/independence” growth activity. Students are asked to dive into a complex topic (hexadecimal encoding/decoding of text) without much support. But it’s actually not that hard. The goal is to encourage all students to not shut down when something sounds complicated and to learn how to think creatively and use the power of the web to their benefit.\n\nThey should do a web search for “hex to text converter”\n\n1.

Barn swallows are one of the most common birds in the world and have been the subject of more than 1000 studies, yet published birding field guides and scientific papers have all failed to describe female song or they describe it incorrectly as being the same as male song (females have their own song type). This is an important oversight, because research on male bird song has informed a lot of theory in biology about how populations evolve through mate choice and competition involving vocal communication, and how new species form. \n\nIgnoring the sounds females make may result from inherent biases. Since bird song became an area of scientific study in the 1800s, it was almost exclusively researched by white males in the Northern Hemisphere. Since women have become welcomed into all areas of science, and research institutions have focused more intent study in tropical regions of the world, studies have discovered that female song is the ancestral state (i.e. the ancestor of all living song birds had both singing males and females). Moreover, female song has not been entirely lost in most species. As in the barn swallow, natural selection has favored females that sing less often, and to have more concise songs that are often restricted to the pre-egg-laying part of the breeding season. This drop in female singing after egg-laying is thought to stem from trying not to draw predators to nests. Due to lack of study, the full function of song in competition among females, male mate choice, or other functions is not well understood in most species.\n\nFurther Reading: \n- [Female birds sing.

Students explore one of the primary figures in the study, a scatter plot (graph) showing different patterns of male and female singing output over the breeding season. Importantly, males sang much more than females and for a longer time (May-Aug, rather than just May). Thus, because males sing more frequently, if we assume (as has been common for birders and scientists until recently) that only males sing, your assumptions are reinforced more easily, because you are less likely to see a female sing.\n\nDuring the peer review process, an anonymous scientist suggested that the scatter plot was not a good way to represent the data, instead suggesting that the authors should have displayed a histogram. In Parts 2 and 3 of the lesson, students aggregate (combine) the authentic study data in order to create a histogram. They must then interpret the data in both formats (deepening their understanding of how histograms and scatter plots relate to each other), and conclude which is a better way to demonstrate the study’s findings, explaining why.\n\nFor further reflection, students are then asked to synthesize what they have learned, along with new information presented to them. Why has female song been missed? Partially because of a pre-existing assumption that females don't sing, along with less common singing behavior in females. Why do females sing less? Because natural selection favors females who sing less. Females must sit on eggs for around 2 weeks, leaving them open to predation. If they were to sing as loudly and provocatively as males, they would attract predators which would eat them or their eggs, passing on no genes. Thus, natural selection has likely caused female song to be lost, simplified, or to be produced for short time periods during establishment of the breeding season in many species around the world.","InitiallyExpanded":true},{"__component":"lesson-plan.section-heading","id":4,"SectionTitle":"Standards"},{"__component":"lesson-plan.steam-badge","id":1,"Title":"About the GP Learning Chart","Description":"This Galactic Polymath Learning Chart illustrates the areas of knowledge covered.
