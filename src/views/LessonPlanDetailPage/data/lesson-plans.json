Students learn how scientists and birders alike have assumed that most female birds don't sing for decades. As students explore real data from a recent study, they will learn how this assumption could be reinforced by the fact that females sing much less than males, and has limited our understanding of how birds communicate for decades. [See Scientific Background](#background) for details.\n  \nThe lesson will take 3 class periods for most learners. Students dive in with a data literacy puzzle, which we call a “Polymath Puzzle.” Students are given a figure from a current scientific study on barn swallows (a common bird across the world), but with text elements coded with an alphabetic shift (e.g. each letter is shifted: A to B, B to C, and so on). They have to work in teams (or individually) to decipher the messages, and then try to understand the figure. This is a high-level data literacy task that piques students’ natural love of puzzle-solving, while working on GRIT/grappling and the [21st Century Skills (4 Cs)](https://www.aeseducation.com/blog/four-cs-21st-century-skills). Videos guide students through each stage of the Polymath Puzzle. In Parts 2 and 3, students create and interpret histograms from the same data, allowing for a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of scatter plots and histograms for visualizing data patterns. The culminating task is for students to synthesize the conclusions from the two types of graph, along with additional background information to hypothesize a reason for why female song has been missed until 2020 in this widely studied species.\n\n## Skip to [Teaching Resources](#teaching_materials_&_requirements)\n  \n  "

The “Nearly Impossible Task” Mystery Hook (5E: Engage & Explore)  \n\n\n#### 1. Introduction:\n![seg_1of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_1of6_a15a60686b.png)\n\nTeacher instructs students to work on their own or in groups to decipher the alphabetic shift. (See Lesson Preview for a walkthrough on strategies). Make sure not to mention anything about what the study is about!\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hook:\n![seg_2of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_2of6_fc645fa7b0.png)\nStudents decipher the Polymath Puzzle as an engagement hook for this challenging data literacy task.\na.   Students work in groups to determine alphabetic shift  there are multiple approaches to this. See videos in  Preview presentation to see an explanation.\nb.   Students decode labels in graph\nc.   Students attempt to interpret the figure.\n\nIf they are having trouble, ask them to notice everything they can about the figure (axes, patterns, differences). You want them to pay attention in particular to differences in song production across the sexes. Whatever the males are (they may think they’re humans, birds, or whales), they sing more (almost all male points are higher than females on the y-axis). Males also sing for a longer period of time (males sing throughout the breeding season, while females stop singing at the end of May (when they lay eggs; though one cannot\n\n#### 3. Clarify procedure/scaffolding:\n![seg_3of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_3of6_430a83c0aa.png)\n\nShow the video (embedded in presentation) explaining the cipher and different strategies students might have adopted to solve it. Invite them to share challenges and how they overcame them. This is a great opportunity to stress the importance of creativity, collaboration, and grit for problem solving.\n\n#### 4. Hypothesize about the graph:\n![seg_4of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_4of6_bc702e8355.png)\n\nIn live/in-person classes, invite students to discuss their observations about the graph and hypotheses for what the figure means. If no one is volunteering, consider having students write responses and provide them to you digitally or on scraps of paper. Encourage creative, or detailed observations without giving away who is right. Gently redirect students who seem to be off-track by asking them questions. Important to encourage good questions, logic, and worry less about accuracy, modelling inquiry and growth mindset.\n\n\n#### 5. Mystery Reveal:\n![seg_5of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_5of6_0f8a70bace.png)\n\nShow the “reveal” video in the presentation. The video shows the lead author of the birdsong study discussing the background of the figure and how the data was collected. Debrief with students to assess learning and engagement. Ask them what this left them more curious about.\n\n#### 6. Pivot to Histograms:\n![seg_6of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_6of6_8fbc7f86a4.png)\n\nStudents learn about how an anonymous scientist disagreed about the use of the scatter plot to visualize the data, and suggested to use a histogram. Great opportunity to connect with other lessons on peer review, though this lesson focuses on how data visuals all have pros and cons and how choice of visuals affects how well readers/viewers are able to perceive patterns in the data. Major point: data visuals can be as rich as a written text in telling a story about the world. The lesson ends with a brief intro to histograms, which we will build on"

They are asked to dive into a complex topic (hexadecimal encoding/decoding of text) without much support. But it’s actually not that hard.

        "Content": "### Scientific Background\n\nThis lesson is based on a recent study that describes female song in barn swallows for the first time. Barn swallows are one of the most common birds in the world and have been the subject of more than 1000 studies, yet published birding field guides and scientific papers have all failed to describe female song or they describe it incorrectly as being the same as male song (females have their own song type). This is an important oversight, because research on male bird song has informed a lot of theory in biology about how populations evolve through mate choice and competition involving vocal communication, and how new species form. \n\nIgnoring the sounds females make may result from inherent biases. Since bird song became an area of scientific study in the 1800s, it was almost exclusively researched by white males in the Northern Hemisphere. Since women have become welcomed into all areas of science, and research institutions have focused more intent study in tropical regions of the world, studies have discovered that female song is the ancestral state (i.e. the ancestor of all living song birds had both singing males and females). Moreover, female song has not been entirely lost in most species. As in the barn swallow, natural selection has favored females that sing less often, and to have more concise songs that are often restricted to the pre-egg-laying part of the breeding season. This drop in female singing after egg-laying is thought to stem from trying not to draw predators to nests. Due to lack of study, the full function of song in competition among females, male mate choice, or other functions is not well understood in most species.\n\nFurther Reading: \n- [Female birds sing.

        "Content": "### Lesson Connections to this Research\n\nThis lesson allows students to explore the actual data from [the study](https://www.unco.edu/nhs/biology/about-us/benedict-lauryn/documents/publications/Wilkins_et_al_2020.pdf) and to hear from the study’s lead author to deepen data literacy and understanding of the scientific method. Students explore one of the primary figures in the study, a scatter plot (graph) showing different patterns of male and female singing output over the breeding season. Importantly, males sang much more than females and for a longer time (May-Aug, rather than just May). Thus, because males sing more frequently, if we assume (as has been common for birders and scientists until recently) that only males sing, your assumptions are reinforced more easily, because you are less likely to see a female sing.\n\nDuring the peer review process, an anonymous scientist suggested that the scatter plot was not a good way to represent the data, instead suggesting that the authors should have displayed a histogram. In Periods 2 and 3 of the lesson, students aggregate (combine) the authentic study data in order to create a histogram. They must then interpret the data in both formats (deepening their understanding of how histograms and scatter plots relate to each other), and conclude which is a better way to demonstrate the study’s findings, explaining why.\n\nFor further reflection, students are then asked to synthesize what they have learned, along with new information presented to them. Why has female song been missed? Partially because of a pre-existing assumption that females don't sing, along with less common singing behavior in females. Why do females sing less? Because natural selection favors females who sing less. Females must sit on eggs for around 2 weeks, leaving them open to predation. If they were to sing as loudly and provocatively as males, they would attract predators which would eat them or their eggs, passing on no genes. Thus, natural selection has likely caused female song to be lost, simplified, or to be produced for short time periods during establishment of the breeding season in many species around the world."

This lesson targets a mathematical understanding of the connections between scatterplots, dot plots, and histograms, but also aligns to national standards across all 4 subjects: Common Core Math and ELA; Next Generation Science; and College, Career, and Civic Life Social Studies Standards. Specific standards codes and statements are listed below.\n\nIn total, there are 41 standards across the 3 grade band lesson versions (G5-6, 7-8, and 9-12). There are about 13 standard alignments per grade.",
        "Footnote": "**Notes on Standards**\n\n*Standards are broken down into “Target” and “Connected” categories. Target standards are directly reinforced or taught; connected standards are not fully addressed in the lesson, but connected enough to provide a foundation for teachers to build upon.\n\n**For each standard, a sample formative question and a rubric for responses are provided as a guide for assessing student",

I love how it combines actual research and allows the students the opportunity for analysis. I also love the fact that the peer review process is included in the explanation for the types of graphs used. This really allows students to see and understand the scientific process in action. Love it!!  \n>   \n> –Sarah Huneycutt, Homeschool Teacher in Nashville, TN\n\n### Students\n> I really enjoy this lesson! It is so engaging and fun! \n>  \n> –11th Grader in Nashville, TN\n  \n> My biggest takeaway from the lesson was the importance of choosing the right way to display data...I don’t have any negative feedback…I really liked the lesson and appreciated how it was interactive and not just a lecture, like many of my online classes have become.\n>  \n> –11th Grader in Nashville, TN\n  \n### Got suggestions or feedback? \n#### We want to know what you think!\nPlease share your thoughts using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdz7_81uUZrsmEfdXk-DPW5J72gViBUO-cy2sakojs5sqAAqQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we will use it to improve this and other future lessons."
