          "Description": "This lesson teaches students about data visualization (how to read and interpret scatter plots, dot plots, and histograms), and connects to a broader theme of how our assumptions affect our conclusions. Students learn how scientists and birders alike have assumed for decades that most female birds don't sing. As students explore real data from a recent study, they will learn how this assumption could be reinforced by the fact that females sing much less than males, and further, how this biased oversight has limited our understanding of bird research from its very beginnings. <AnchorLink href=\"#background\"> See Scientific Background </AnchorLink> for details.\n\nThe lesson will take 3 class periods for most learners. Students dive in with a data literacy puzzle, which we call a \u201cPolymath Puzzle.\u201d Students are given a figure from a current scientific study on barn swallows (a common bird across the world), but with text elements coded with an alphabetic shift (e.g. each letter is shifted: A to B, B to C, and so on). They have to work in teams (or individually) to decipher the messages, and then try to understand the figure. This is a high-level data literacy task that piques students\u2019 natural love of puzzle-solving, while working on GRIT/grappling and the [21st Century Skills (4 Cs)](https://www.aeseducation.com/blog/four-cs-21st-century-skills). Videos guide students through each stage of the Polymath Puzzle. In Parts 2 and 3, students create and interpret histograms from the same data, allowing for a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of scatter plots and histograms for visualizing data patterns. The culminating task is for students to synthesize the conclusions from the two types of graph, along with additional background information to hypothesize a reason for why female song has been missed until 2020 in this widely studied species."

The Polymath Puzzle in Part 1 draws students into decoding the labels on a graph in order to engage them in trying to understand the next level of meaning in the graph, creating a rich data literacy learning experience. In the first step, students learn that ciphers are used to make a secret message. We use a simple cipher called an alphabetic shift, where each letter of each word in a message has been shifted a certain number of places (e.g. +1 would mean A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on).\nThis section works on assimilating new vocabulary, as well as encouraging students to have a growth mindset.

Barn swallows are one of the most common birds in the world and have been the subject of more than 1000 studies, yet published birding field guides and scientific papers have all failed to describe female song or they describe it incorrectly as being the same as male song (females have their own song type). This is an important oversight, because research on male bird song has informed a lot of theory in biology about how populations evolve through mate choice and competition involving vocal communication, and how new species form. \n\nIgnoring the sounds females make may result from inherent biases. Since bird song became an area of scientific study in the 1800s, it was almost exclusively researched by white males in the Northern Hemisphere. Since women have become welcomed into all areas of science, and research institutions have focused more intent study in tropical regions of the world, studies have discovered that female song is the ancestral state (i.e. the ancestor of all living song birds had both singing males and females). Moreover, female song has not been entirely lost in most species. As in the barn swallow, natural selection has favored females that sing less often, and to have more concise songs that are often restricted to the pre-egg-laying part of the breeding season. This drop in female singing after egg-laying is thought to stem from trying not to draw predators to nests. Due to lack of study, the full function of song in competition among females, male mate choice, or other functions is not well understood in most species.\n\nFurther Reading: \n- [Why We Didn't Know That Female Birds Sing](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-it-took-so-long-to-appreciate-female-birds-songs/): Two authors of the study this lesson is based on discuss its broader implications for society and K-12 education.\n- [Female birds sing.

Students explore one of the primary figures in the study, a scatter plot (graph) showing different patterns of male and female singing output over the breeding season. Importantly, males sang much more than females and for a longer time (May-Aug, rather than just May). Thus, because males sing more frequently, if we assume (as has been common for birders and scientists until recently) that only males sing, your assumptions are reinforced more easily, because you are less likely to see a female sing.\n\nDuring the peer review process, an anonymous scientist suggested that the scatter plot was not a good way to represent the data, instead suggesting that the authors should have displayed a histogram. In Parts 2 and 3 of the lesson, students aggregate (combine) the authentic study data in order to create a histogram. They must then interpret the data in both formats (deepening their understanding of how histograms and scatter plots relate to each other), and conclude which is a better way to demonstrate the study\u2019s findings, explaining why.\n\nFor further reflection, students are then asked to synthesize what they have learned, along with new information presented to them. Why has female song been missed? Partially because of a pre-existing assumption that females don't sing, along with less common singing behavior in females. Why do females sing less? Because natural selection favors females who sing less. Females must sit on eggs for around 2 weeks, leaving them open to predation. If they were to sing as loudly and provocatively as males, they would attract predators which would eat them or their eggs, passing on no genes. Thus, natural selection has likely caused female song to be lost, simplified, or to be produced for short time periods during establishment of the breeding season in many species around the world.",

I love how it combines actual research and allows the students the opportunity for analysis. I also love the fact that the peer review process is included in the explanation for the types of graphs used. This really allows students to see and understand the scientific process in action. Love it!!  \n> **Overall Rating:** 5/5  \n> **Student Engagement:** 4/5  \n> **Overall Learning:** 5/5  \n> **Would Recommend to Other Teachers:** 5/5  \n> **Student Level:** Grade 8  \n>   \n> \u2013Sarah Huneycutt, Homeschool Teacher in Nashville, TN\n\n#### Students\n> I really enjoy this lesson! It is so engaging and fun! \n>  \n> \u201311th Grader in Nashville, TN\n\n> I think it looks like a very interactive lesson and it will hopefully be engaging and interesting to some students. It looks uncomplicated and it gives you all of the resources you will ever need for the lesson. The fact that it shows you how to create graphs and diagrams in the individual powerpoints is a good attribute in my opinion. \n> -11th Grader in Savannah, GA\n  \n> My biggest takeaway from the lesson was the importance of choosing the right way to display data...I don\u2019t have any negative feedback\u2026I really liked the lesson and appreciated how it was interactive and not just a lecture, like many of my online classes have become.\n>  \n> \u201311th Grader in Nashville, TN",

            "Description": "Students learn about genetic rescue, an approach for helping endangered populations recover by introducing closely related individuals from a different population. The lesson is framed around the story of Florida panthers, which are a classic success story for genetic rescue. First, students explore Florida panther recovery through the lens of different stakeholders (ranchers, city-dwellers, and Native Americans), discussing ways that each group may have positive or negative associations with panthers. In Day 2, they then explore different options for helping panthers recovery, discussing pros and cons of genetic rescue, captive breeding, or doing nothing. Day 3 provides necessary scaffolding for a deeper dive into genetic rescue by explaining key concepts in the context of Florida panthers. Students also simulate matings to better understand why inbreeding and recessive traits are so problematic in small populations.\n\nIn Day 4, go deeper into genetic rescue: what can go wrong, and students provide evidence of their understanding of how all the concepts connect through a concept mapping exercise, interspersed with our carefully crafted explainer videos. A key take-home is that even though genetic rescue worked in Florida panthers, it's quite risky to test out conservation strategies on an endangered species. The concluding task is to analyze a table of organisms and their characteristics to determine which would be good models to study the effectiveness of genetic rescue without risking a rare species' extinction. Day 5 builds on this to reveal Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick's (this lesson's sponsor) research using Trinidadian guppies as a model of genetic rescue. Students then spend much of the class period analyzing real, paired data collected from Florida panthers and guppies. They are asked to compare and label graphs from both species, and synthesize broader conclusions. The lesson leaves open many options for project-based lessons and independent projects."

              "description": "Did you know Florida had panthers? The Florida panther, Puma concolor coryi, is a critically endangered species in the southern regions of Florida. Once rare and almost never seen, the Florida panther has bounced back from a brush with extinction to the point where more frequent encounters have people asking questions about this apex predator. There are misconceptions, misinformation, and misunderstandings about the panther and its habitat, so ecologist and filmmaker Chris Morgan travelled to Florida to get to the bottom of it. ",

              "description": "This video is part of \"Genetic Rescue to the Rescue,\" a Galactic Polymath lesson about endangered species, why they matter, what we lose if they go extinct, and what we can do to save them. \nFlorida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) nearly went extinct in the 1990s. Here, we learn what happened and how wildlife managers tried to bring them back. Through this story, we explore connected concepts of how habitat fragmentation affects the flow of genes, and how this can lead to increasing risk of extinction in endangered species (the \"Extinction Vortex\"). The video ends with an open-ended question about what common species we could use to study endangered species recovery so that we don't run the chance of inadvertently destroying what we're trying to save.\nCheck out the lesson at https://www.galacticpolymath.com/lessons",
